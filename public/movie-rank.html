<h3>Garfield, The Movie</h3>
<p>Great kids movie. Cute.</p>
<h3>IF</h3>
<p>More of a young adult movie vs kid movie. My kids were not that interested, but it was clever and a handful of parts that were funny, but most funny scenese were in the previous.</p>
<h3>Cabarini</h3>
<p>Real life film about a Italian woman that didn't take no for an answer.</p>
